          <p class="dark-boxes">
          My name is Chris Nussbaum and I am a college student enrolled at Pacific Lutheran University seeking a Bachelor of Arts in Communication and a minor in Marketing.
          I am a very active individual who enjoys the outdoors and pushing my physical and mental limits in academics, athletics, and everything I do.

          <img src="./img/logo_The CN Network.png"><br><br><br>
          <p class="dark-boxes">
          I decided to create a personal website using programming languages HTML and CSS because I wanted to showcase my capstone project to my professors, classmates, friends, and family of Pacific Lutheran University due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
          After some thought, I realized I could use this website for networking purposes which led me to adding an additional tab that includes my resume, and a photo gallery.
          On this website, there is a <b><u><i>Home</i></u></b> tab, a <b><u><i>Capstone</i></u></b> tab, and a <b><u><i>Portfolio</i></u></b> tab. Have a look, and check out my social media while you're at it!</p>
          <br><br><br><br>
          <hr><h3 class="page-title">Mission</h3>
          <img src="./img/running.PNG"><br><br><br>
          <p class="dark-boxes">
          The motivation behind creating <i><b>The CN Network</b></i> stemmed from wanting to have a platform where I could make connections with employers, college-students,
          and anyone who wanted to connect. A future goal I hope to achieve through this network is to pave an avenue for college students who are in search of jobs post-graduation.
          This platform can be used to showcase their identity in many forms (blogs, projects, resume, social media, etc.), and will give employers multiple angles and perspectives of their character.
          Although websites like LinkedIn and Wix serve similar purposes, I believe having a platform where people could design a website through coding practices would be challenging and rewarding.
          Find out more about the mission of this website in my reflection paper which can be found in the <b><u>Capstone</u></b> tab.</p>
