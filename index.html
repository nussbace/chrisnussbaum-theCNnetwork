          <p class="dark-boxes">
          My name is Chris Nussbaum and I am an Administrative Assistant at Microsoft, a freelance UI Designer, a part-time Technical Writer for Iterate.ai, and an outdoor enthusiast who enjoys going on hikes, running, playing basketball, and hanging out with my girlfriend whenever I have the time. In May of 2020, I graduated Pacific Lutheran University with a BA in Communication and Minor in Business Marketing. I have always been intrigued by technology, the business world, and how people interact with technology in their everyday lives. I am inspired by great creative minds like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, and athletes such as Stephen Curry and Steve Prefontaine.

          <img src="./img/logo_The CN Network.png"><br><br><br>
          <p class="dark-boxes">
          I decided to create a personal website using programming languages HTML and CSS because I wanted to showcase my capstone project to my professors, classmates, friends, and family of Pacific Lutheran University due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
          After some thought, I realized I could use this website for networking purposes which led me to adding an additional tab that includes my resume, and a photo gallery.
          On this website, there is a <b><u><i>Home</i></u></b> tab and a <b><u><i>Capstone</i></u></b> tab. Have a look, and check out my social links while you're at it!</p>

          <h3 class="page-title">Mission</h3>
          <img src="./img/running.PNG"><br><br><br>
          <p class="dark-boxes">
          The motivation behind creating <i><b>The CN Network</b></i> stemmed from wanting to have a platform where I could make connections with employers, colleagues,
          and the public via the web.
