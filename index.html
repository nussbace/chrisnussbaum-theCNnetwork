          <p class="dark-boxes">
          My name is Chris Nussbaum and I am a college student enrolled at Pacific Lutheran University seeking a Bachelor of Arts in Communication and a minor in Marketing.
          I am a very active individual who enjoys the outdoors and pushing my physical and mental limits both in academic pursuits and through long distance running.
          Head to the "portfolio" tab if you want to take a deep dive into what I'm made of!</p><br><br><br><hr>
          <h1 class="page-title">What</h1>
          <img src="./img/logo_The CN Network.png"><br><br>
          <p class="dark-boxes">
          I am a self-taught coder and decided to create a personal website using programming languages HTML and CSS for the challenge of it and because I thought it would be fun to design something from scratch.
          I initially created this website to showcase my capstone project to my professors, classmates, friends, and family of Pacific Lutheran University due to the COVID-19 pandemic but realized I could use this website to network for the long-term.
          On this website, there is an <b><u><i>About</i></u></b> tab, a <b><u><i>Capstone</i></u></b> tab, and a <b><u><i>Portfolio</i></u></b> tab which contain their respective content. Have a look, and check out my social media while you're at it!</p>
          <br><br><br>
          <hr><h1 class="page-title">Mission</h1>
          <img src="./img/running.PNG"><br><br>
          <p class="dark-boxes">
          The objective of <i><b><u>The CN Network</u></b></i> is to network with employers from all over the web within the job market. What I want to gain from this website is to create connections with employers, college-students,
          and anyone wanting to illustrate their accomplishments and believe they have more to offer of themselves than their resume. A future goal I hope to achieve with this network is to pave an avenue for college students who are in search of jobs post-graduation.
          This platform can be used to showcase their identity in many forms (blogs, projects, resume, social media, etc.), and will give employers multiple angles and perspectives of their character.</p><br>
