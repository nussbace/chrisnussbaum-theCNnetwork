      <h1>Objective</h1><hr>
      <br>
      <p>
        Capstone serves as a “culminating experience,” a way to synthesize and demonstrate what you have learned in the Communication field during your time at PLU.
        It is a guided exploration that takes you through asking good questions to research design to project scope to theoretical application to final product and presentation.
        Be selfish with your time and energy. Choose a project you really want to do and take ownership of it. I am here to help facilitate that goal.<br><br>
        <b>1.</b> To scope a semester-length project or paper that demonstrates learning in Communication.<br>
        <b>2.</b> To demonstrate an ability to conduct research on a proposed topic.<br>
        <b>3.</b> To apply theory to application either through a project or research paper.<br>
        <b>4.</b> To evidence senior-level college writing in content, style, and format.<br>
        <b>5.</b> To present your work to an audience of experts and non-experts so it is understood.
      </p><br>

      <br>
      <p>
        Broadly speaking, this is an opportunity to take knowledge and theory from the classroom and apply it to solve a problem, capitalize on an opportunity,
        extend creative work you started in another class, and even connect with a field of interest for employment.
        You may work in teams, if you choose, depending on the scope of work.</p>

    <h1>Presentation</h1><hr>
    <br>
      <p>
        Throughout your time in Communication at PLU, you have been introduced to the standards of public speaking and given many opportunities to develop your skill.
        The Capstone presentation is a final demonstration of competency -- how well have you learned to express yourself in this format.
        If you are working as an individual (so this is likely most of you), you will deliver a 10-15 minute presentation on your project or paper.
        If you are working in a small team, you will deliver a 15-20 minute presentation on your project. After your presentation either as individuals or in teams,
        you should be prepared to take questions and comments from the audience.<br><br>
        <b><u>Time</b>:</u><br> 10-15 minutes for individuals, 15-20 minutes for teams.<br><br>
        <b><u>Medium</b>:</u><br> Using your smart phone or other video recording equipment, please record your final Capstone presentation and upload it to the
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1-14Ki5Q63O64SpcQwg7fw" target="_blank"><u>PLU Communication Department</u></a> channel by
        <i>Wednesday, May 20</i>.<br><br>
        <b><u>Audience</b>:</u><br> Because we are in a distance learning environment, our department becomes our audience!
        If you are safely in the company of others, you are welcome to have an audience from wherever you record your presentation. <br><br>
        <b><u>Outline</b>:</u><br> Speakers must speak from a 1-2 page extemporaneous outline.
        There are some exceptions to the 1-2 page limit such as making the font larger or lengthy quotes from research sources. <br><br>
        <b><u>Organization</b>:</u><br> Your individual presentations should be organized. The speech should have an introduction, body, and conclusion (this should NOT be your name and topic statement).
        Your introduction should have an attention getter, justification/link to the audience, thesis, and preview. The body has about 3 main points.
        The conclusion includes a review and a statement of closure (that is NOT “thanks” or “any questions?”). <br><br>
        <b><u>Content</b>:</u><br> The content of the speech should be the support and evidence used to clarify, prove, and illustrate the claim of each main point. You need to incorporate and develop <i>ethos, logos</i>, and <i>pathos</i>.
        You can certainly play audio or video clips, but they should not comprise more than 20% of your presentation time. <br><br>
        <b><u>Delivery</b>:</u><br> This speech should be practiced, professional, and polished. You are expected to use purposeful movement, gestures, eye contact, and facial expressions. You are expected to dress professionally.
        You need to plan and practice your delivery, preparing and practicing in advance. <br><br>
        <b><u>Auidence Responsibilities</b>:</u><br> Each of you is responsible for evaluating 2 colleagues’ speeches.<br>

        <p>The Project Notebook is a place where I brainstormed ideas for my capstone project.
        This notebook includes my capstone project idea of developing a machine learning model for an api that will be able to identify news deemed as credible by <i>The Trust Project</i>
        standards via the web. Due to unprecedented circumstances involving the COVID-19 pandemic, I have been limited with this project and been forced to scale down the project
        in regards to the development of the api itself. However, I still went ahead and made a blueprint for the eventual implimentation of this program which includes coding approaches,
        research on internet archives, databases and their functions, a handful of computer models, and other tools and frameworks neccessary to see this project through. I've also created a table listing off
        credible news sites retrieved from <i>Wikipedia</i>- including the name of the news media, their means of distribution, main media type, and when they were founded / launched.
        I also included the psuedo code paramaters for the The CN Network- the website you are currently on.

      <p>The Code Book is based off of <i>The Trust Project's</i> "Core Trust Indicators and Editorial Attributes" table. In this code book, the eight core trust indicators and their attributes are meant to offer transparency across multiple dimensions.
      In each individual tab (9 total), there is a color coded legend. The color code element is an attempt to make it easier for people to navigate through the code book, although confusing at first glance.
      To gather all the information, I took the content provided by the <i>Markkula Center for Applied Ethics</i> and put it into an excel spreadsheet. <br><br>

      The indicators and their attributes were identified from user research and defined by working groups of top editors from around the world.
      <i>The Trust Project</i> is an organization based in southern California that fights off misinformation, pop filter bubbles, and has a goal to elevate trustworthy, and ethically produced news so that both the public and news distribution platforms can find it easily.
      Their transparency standards help newsrooms show how they are fulfilling journalism’s basic pledge: to serve society with a truthful, intelligent and comprehensive account of events and ideas.<br><br>

      When you open up the code book, you will see lots of colors, words, numbers, and letters. These are all intended to serve a specific purpose. I made revisions, adjumstments and additions to the code book by accessing the
      documents linked to all eight indicators and the byline exemption, and put the information collected within the documents onto an excel spreadsheet.
      In the documents, there are components consisting of attributes, definitions, and examples of the attributes that are used to identify whether a news source is credible.<br><br>

      A couple of noteable elements to look out for in the code book is the attribute within an indicator, and whether it is recommended. This tells people whether an attribute is a must-have in a news source.
      Example- linkage to an "Ethics Policy" that pertains to a news entity is a required attribute by <i>The Trust Project</i>. You will notice that the attributes are numbered. Some of them are paired in the same category (i.e. a, b, etc.).
      This means that they go hand in hand with the core attribute. For example, the "Corrections Policy is the 3rd indicator, while "Show Corrections", and "Corrected Article" are labeled as attributes 3b and 3c.
      Each attribute has an embeded link that can be accessed on the table of contents tab of the excel spreadsheet under the "Attribute" header to documentation provided by <i>The Trust Project</i>. I used these documents
      to create an organized code book that would make it possible for me to continue on with the next phase in this highly-complex project. The phase- to create coding paramaters for the machine learning model.<br><br>

      The premise of this project was to create a machine learning model for an api (appication program interface) that would be able to distinguish credible news sources from non-credible news sources on the web, as stated previously in the Project Notebook section.
      Using the attribute, the description of the specified attribute, an example of the attribute found through an internet archive called <i>The Wayback Machine</i>, I brainstormed methods to locate attributes of the indicators in web pages of news media sites. Since I have been limited
      the resources to collaborate with professors, friends, and colleagues because of the COVID-19 pandemic, I was unable to work on brainstorming methods for all the attributes. I did manage to get around to brainstomring methods for the <i>Best Practices Indicator</i>.
      However, with the time and resources available post-pandemic, I will be able to continue filling in the gaps and missing content that pertain to the development of the program.<br><br>

      Originally, I thought to name this program the Credible News Identifier (CNI) because of its purpose to identify news accurately using attributes within the eight (+byline exemption) indicators. Sometime in the forseable future, I hope to connect with software engineers, and other personnel to look into
      the uses of databases and applications- DynamoDB Chrome Extension, MongoDB, etc., to create a prototype for the CNI program. The prototype was only going to include what was only feasible to complete prior to the due date of the capstone
      project. The intent was to complete a working api prototype for a couple of the attributes in the <i>Best Practices Indicator.</i><br><br>

      In order to test the programs functionality, Dr. Hoyt of the communication department and Dr. Renzhi of the computer science department were going to help me finalize a strategic approach to collect training and testing data that the program could learn from- and observe patterns of both credible news
      sources and non-credible news sources. For example, I would collect samples of an ethics policy using <i>The Wayback Machine</i> and other avenues of retrieval, and store those sources into seperate folders that would identify as pass and fail.
      For example, if a news source like CNN had an ethics policy found anywhere on their website (through the usage of scraping data and other methods (power thesaurus api- identifies like-phrases and expressions)), then the api would identify that the website would pass for that specific attribute.
      This does not mean the source is credible, however, it does indicate that they are one step closer to being considered as more credible than a source that did not have an ethics policy.<br><br>

      In programming, computers read in binary, which means they operate off of a 0 to 1 scale. This means that the api would compute and categorize the success rate (pass or fail) of an attribute into either 0's or 1's. Credible sources would read as a 1, while non-credible sources would read as 0.
      Since the api would be taking in so much information and being fed lots and lots of sources to learn from using machine learning models- such as Generative Adversarial Network Systems (GANs), it will most likely not have a 100% passing rate. That is why a passing rate percentage is neccessary.
      The passing rate determines the success rate of the api in identifying a specific attribute. If an ethics policy was found in 88 of the 100 sources that were said to have ethics policies, then the success rate of the api in respect to that attribute is 88%. This same principle would be applied for the
      remaining attributes, given adjustments in methods and approaches to each attribute depending on the context.<br><br>

      It is also important to note that the information I gathered was collected from working groups consisting of journalists / professionals all around the world tackling the ongoing fight of misinformation- and their organizations who contributed their time and energy to
      <i>The Trust Project</i> branding identity, the trust indicators and their editorial and technical definitions, and the implementation of the trust indicators on their first member websites. The information gathered belongs to <i>The Trust Project</i>. I simply organized (converted information in word documents onto an excel spreadsheet)
      and made additions (coding paramaters and methods) to their already established work.<br><br>

           I am a self-taught coder and decided to create a personal website using programming languages HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (style sheet language used for the presentation of the website) with editing software Atom (an open-source text and source code editor).
           I decided to go through with the development of this project because I wanted to expand what I knew of coding, and because it was fun creating a website from scratch.
           This website brings many benefits to it as it is a platform I can use to demonstrate all the work I have done for this project, as well as make additions that I feel are neccessary for networking- resume, photos, etc.
           <br><br>
           I initially created this website to present this capstone project virtually to my professors, classmates, friends, and family of Pacific Lutheran University in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, but realized I could use this website to network for the long-term.
           This website gives me a platform to put the culmination of all my work onto one place while making it accessible to everyone. It is also interactive in that it allows people to click on images, tabs, and social media to be further engaged with the content.
           The website was designed to be easy to navigate from tab to tab, and aesthetically appealing to look at.<br><br>
